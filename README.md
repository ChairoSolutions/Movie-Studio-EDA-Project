## Project Overview
This project explores a dataset containing information about movies, including titles, genres, ratings, and revenue. The goal was to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and prepare insights for visualization and reporting.

1. **Data Inspection and Cleaning**
   - Check data types and handle missing values.
   - Identify and remove duplicate rows.
   - Ensure columns of interest are correctly formatted for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summarize numerical and categorical features.
   - Prepare a cleaned version of the dataset suitable for Tableau or other visualization tools.

3. **Notebook Handling**
   - Ensure that all Jupyter notebooks are properly structured and functional.
   - Maintain version control to avoid corrupted files during collaboration.

4. **Documentation**
   - Add clear comments in the notebook for clarity.
